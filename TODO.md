# TODOS
 - [ ] Change variant to expose index and be able to find index of given type switch statement can be used
 - [ ] Mitigate self-intersections for reflected/refracter rays and later for shadow rays
 - [ ] Convert tracer to use shadow rays and explicit lights
 - [ ] Add more light variants (area light, sphere light, spot light, ...)
 - [ ] Add BVH generation and tracing
 - [ ] Add mesh type which also holds transform (thinking of only having transforms for meshes aka composites of primitives, but keep primitives with absolute coordinates)
 - [ ] Add uvs and vertex properties for interpolation
 - [ ] Add albedo, normal, material property, ... texturing
